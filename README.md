# Casting Agency

This project is the capstone project for my Udacity Fullstack Developer nanodegree. The project is to help simplify the process of creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. There are 3 main users of this system these are: Executive Producer, Casting Director ans Casting Assistant. The Casting Assistant can view actors and movies. The Casting Director can add or delete actors, modify actors and movies and view actors and movies. The Executive Producer can perform all acctions the Casting Assistant and Casting Director can perform including adding or deleting a movie.

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). 

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development 
Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.

#### Backend

From the backend folder run `pip install requirements.txt`. All required packages are included in the requirements file. 

To run the application run the following commands: 
```
export FLASK_APP=app
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the `app.py` file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made. If running locally on Windows, look for the commands in the [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/factory/).

The application is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration. 

#### Frontend

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client: 
```
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm run serve 
```

By default, the frontend will run on localhost:8080. 

### Tests
In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands: 

```
dropdb agency_test
createdb agency_test
python test.py
```

The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command. 

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality.

### API Reference
## Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```bash
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 404,
    "message": "resource not found"
}
The API will return one of these error types when requests fail:

404: Resource Not Found
422: Not Processable
500: server error
400: bad request
401: unauthorized
403: forbidden
